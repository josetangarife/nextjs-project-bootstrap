Below is a detailed step‐by‐step implementation plan for a modern, responsive landing page that markets your software development company’s services. The plan lists every dependent file and explains the changes required, error handling strategies, and UI/UX considerations. Follow the outline below:

---

**1. Create the Landing Page (src/app/page.tsx)**

- **File Creation:**  
  - Create a new file named `page.tsx` inside the `src/app` folder.  
  - This will serve as the main landing page for your website.

- **Page Structure and Sections:**  
  - Use semantic HTML5 elements to divide the page into sections:  
  – Header (navigation)  
  – Hero (a large impactful banner with a tagline, a call-to-action button, and a background image using a placeholder URL as per guidelines)  
  – About Us (brief company info and strengths)  
  – Services (a grid/list of service cards)  
  – Contact (embedded contact form)  
  – Footer (company details and additional links)

- **Implementation Tips:**  
  - Ensure proper error handling in any dynamic elements (e.g., image onError fallback for the hero image).  
  - Incorporate anchor links in the header that scroll to the respective section IDs (using smooth scrolling in CSS).

---

**2. Develop Reusable UI Components**

- **Header Component (src/components/Header.tsx):**  
  - Create a new file `Header.tsx` to hold a navigation bar with links such as “Inicio”, “Servicios” y “Contacto”.  
  - Use plain HTML and CSS classes for spacing and modern typography (avoid external icon libraries).

- **Footer Component (src/components/Footer.tsx):**  
  - Create `Footer.tsx` to display your company’s contact information and any legal notices.  
  - Ensure the footer layout adapts well across devices.

- **ServiceCard Component (src/components/ServiceCard.tsx):**  
  - Build a card component that accepts props: title, description, and optionally an image URL.  
  - For each service (e.g., Desarrollo Web, Desarrollo Móvil, Consultoría TI), display a placeholder image (using a URL like `https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Detailed+Service+Card+Image+for+Desarrollo+Web`) with proper alt text and an onerror fallback.  
  - Use a clean card layout with a title, brief description, subtle borders, and hover effects.

- **ContactForm Component (src/components/ContactForm.tsx):**  
  - Create a form that collects name, email, and message.  
  - Implement client-side validation (using React useState) to flag any empty fields before submission.  
  - If errors exist, dynamically display error messages above the form fields.  
  - Consider a try/catch block for any asynchronous submission (if integrated with backend later).

---

**3. Update Global Styles (src/app/globals.css)**

- **Styling Requirements:**  
  - Define global typography, color palette (modern, minimal: white background with contrasting primary and accent colors), and spacing.  
  - Add custom CSS classes for each section (e.g., `.hero-section`, `.services-section`, `.about-section`, `.contact-section`).

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Include media queries to adjust font sizes, layout (e.g., grid-to-column switch for service cards), and spacing on mobile devices.

---

**4. Integration and UI/UX Considerations**

- **Hero Section Enhancements:**  
  - Use a full-width placeholder image for the hero, e.g.:  
  `const heroImage = "https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Professional+software+development+company+landing+page";`  
  - Provide descriptive alt text and an onError attribute handler.

- **Services Section:**  
  - Dynamically render multiple `ServiceCard` components.  
  - Display brief details and a “Más información” button on each card.

- **Contact Section:**  
  - Embed the `ContactForm` with proper form validation and error feedback.  
  - Use clear labels and spacing to enhance usability.

- **Navigation & Accessibility:**  
  - Ensure that header links use semantic `<nav>` elements and that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.  
  - Include ARIA attributes where necessary for screen readers.

- **Error Handling Best Practices:**  
  - Validate form inputs on the client side and display user-friendly error messages.  
  - Gracefully handle image loading errors using onerror fallback in `<img>` tags.

---

**5. Testing and Final Integration**

- **Local Testing:**  
  - Run the Next.js development server to test the landing page layout and component interactions.  
  - Simulate form submissions to ensure client-side validation triggers as expected.

- **Quality Assurance:**  
  - Confirm that the page is responsive across different screen sizes and that navigation links properly anchor to their designated sections.

---

**Summary**

- Create a new landing page file at `src/app/page.tsx` with sectioned content (hero, about, services, contact, footer).  
- Develop reusable components: Header, Footer, ServiceCard, and ContactForm with built-in error handling and validation.  
- Update global styles in `src/app/globals.css` with modern typography, color schemes, and responsive design.  
- Use semantic HTML and accessible design practices for a user-friendly experience.  
- Utilize placeholder images with appropriate descriptive alt texts and graceful error fallbacks.  
- Integrate smooth scrolling navigation and clear call-to-actions.  
- Test comprehensively using local Next.js development.  
- This plan ensures a professional, scalable, and visually pleasing marketing website for your software development company.
